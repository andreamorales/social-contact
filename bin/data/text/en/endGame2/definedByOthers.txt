As I looked around me, I knew I could not do anything about others living there. However, I could prevent them from defining me.
I was sure of that from the start, the person I am is not the reflection of who they are.
Growing up, I was more and more confident that I would become my own person, not defined by my parents or any one else.
Growing up, I embraced everyone around me, knowing I could learn from them.
As I started living among my people, I knew that I would be shaped by them, and that is how I would become one of them.
As I learned, those we live with shape us. For better or for worse.
