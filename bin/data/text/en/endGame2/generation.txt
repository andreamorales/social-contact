Was it because I was part of the first generations?
In that sense, I was truly one of the first members of that community. Some came after, but I was not sure how they would manage once we would be gone.
Others called us the elders. Generations were born after us; they will never know our feeling of escaping loneliness.
Was it because the others were part of the first generations, and we weren't? They talked of a previous time, but I was only concerned with the present.
Perhaps it was because I was among the youngest. We had come to grasp with death already, and I knew one day my time would come.
All this, all my life and all that was to come, it was because I was part of the last generations.
