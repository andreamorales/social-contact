I did not have any offspring.
I saw children running around, playing. None of them were mine, though.
When I said that I did not want children, they did not believe me.
My life did not change when I had children; I taught them to take care of themselves quickly.
As soon as I had children, life became very different.
I had children. I do not know if all of them survived.
