I never forced anything upon others.
There is no such thing as a justified use of power, so I tried to stay away from those who oppressed others.
I was not respectable enough to have others listen to me -let alone take me seriously.
Others had to listen to me. I was bigger, stronger, and more knowledgeable.
In this situation, I had to be the one to take control, to tell others what to do.
I imposed my will upon others. For good reasons.
