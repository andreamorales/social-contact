Others annoyed me, of course, but it was never enough for me to get violent.
I had to deal with the arrogance of some, but never to the point where I thought about fighting it.
Some of us said they were in control. I certainly did not mind that much.
No one should have told me what to do. They should have expected my reaction, and the consequences.
I am free to do as I want. I am free to not abide by their rules; if I had to resolve to violence, it is only because they were the real criminals.
I never admitted others could impose their will upon me.
