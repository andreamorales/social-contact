It did not make a difference how many there were of us. The land was big enough for all of us.
No matter what, I was still confident we would be able to find fruits, vegetables, nuts. Enough for all of us, however any that would be.
Life was all around us, and it did not always look like us. There would always be more trees than people, so I did not worry.
