I have met a lot of people, over the seasons. I remember some of them. Most died, hunted by beasts.
If I could have had it my way, I would have stayed with every single one that I encountered throughout my journey.
This community is the best I have found. Throughout the land are but hopeless tribes of weaklings. I have met and resent all of them.
