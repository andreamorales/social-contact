I could not stand the loneliness. I always wanted to have someone by my side -no matter how different each one was from the previous one.
Still, I did not mind the loneliness. Others kept on hanging on to me, but I did not do that much.
All we have is not our selves, it is our relationships to others. I never wanted to be alone.
