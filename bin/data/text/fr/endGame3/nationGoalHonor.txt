We were the protectors of our land and people, and failed them both.
Our national arrogance was met with the arrogance of everyone else, and we were overwhelmed.
Our land was pillaged by others. Over time, we came to realize that it was not ours anymore, and ruled by others.
We prevailed through courage, steel and fire.
Others either feared or admired us. We liked both.
Our history echoed with glory throughout the world.
