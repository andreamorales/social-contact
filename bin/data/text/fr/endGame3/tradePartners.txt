Commerce quickly became one of our main activities, and could have become our sole purpose.
Season after season, convoys brought their culture, along with their merchandise.
I often had to deal with foreigners, and that usually involved money. Why else would they come?
The reaches of our economy had married those of our frontiers, and no one came from or went beyond.
Our people subsisted without need for trade.
I never had something that went from afar. Everything was from around here, and everything looked the same.
