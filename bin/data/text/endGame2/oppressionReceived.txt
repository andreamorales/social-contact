I wouldn't imagine others oppressing me.
I was under the impression that some wanted me to act in a particular way, but it was probably just that -an impression.
Some of us acted as if they were in charge. I did not care about them, and did as I wanted.
They said they were in charge, and they said we should listen. So that's what we did, even if we didn't want to.
Their oppression, their desire to have everyone follow their orders, felt inescapable.
The struggle, the oppression was everywhere.
