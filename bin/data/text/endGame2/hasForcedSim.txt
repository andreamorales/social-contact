And then there's this one person who just copied everyone around him. He wanted to fit in so bad, it made us all uncomfortable.
I always remained true to who I was; never felt the need to copy someone else, perhaps in order to better fit in a group.
I did not see the point of adapting who you are to the expectations of others. I am who I am and our community should take it as a given.
In order, perhaps, to fit better with others, I took upon me to change who I was -it wasn't much, but it was still change.
Still, who I was wasn't who I was supposed to be, who others wanted me to be. So I changed, and I found acceptance.
I know I had a moment in my life where I wanted to be like someone else. I don't know what to think of it. The past is the past.
