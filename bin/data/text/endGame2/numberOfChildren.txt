I didn't have any offspring.
I saw children running around, playing. I didn't have children though.
When I said that I didn't want children, they didn't believe me.
My life did not change when I had children; I taught them to take care of themselves quickly.
As soon as I had children, life became very different.
I had children. I don't know if all of them survived.
