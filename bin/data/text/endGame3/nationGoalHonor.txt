We were the protectors of our land and people, and failed them both.
Our national arrogance was met with everyone else's arrogance.
Our land was pillaged by others. Over time, we came to realize that it wasn't ours anymore.
We prevailed through courage, steel and fire.
Others either feared or admired us. We liked both.
Our history echoed with glory throughout the world.
