Social Contact is a game about exploration.$$Social Contact is a gateway into the labyrinth of process, populated by our assumptions.$$Social Contact is a computer-aided artistic rendering of our social selves.
Social Contact is an interactive work of political philosophy$$Our understanding of how we live together is conditioned by what we assume about people.$$Social Contact allows you to simulate the consequences of these assumptions and confront or comfort your own political view. Inspired by the thought experiments of political philosophers from the Enlightenment, it replaces human thought with computer processes, allowing you to focus more on both the starting point and the end result.
Each part of the tryptich looks at one particular question in political philosophy.$$Trying to answer each of these questions then happens in three steps:$$The first screen allows you to choose the particular set of assumptions the computer will use to run the simulation. Vague enough, they are prone to interpretation by both the user and the computer.$$The second screen is the simulation itself, during which it is possible to interact directly. To proceed to the last part, you can select an agent to hear more about the living in that world$$The third part, then, is the written story of that agent, based on both beliefs and experiences. It tells the tale of those who had to live in this world.
