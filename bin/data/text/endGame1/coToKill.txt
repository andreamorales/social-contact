She killed someone. She killed another one like us and left the corpse alone. I don't think the others knew.
As we gathered around, he looked at me. I don't think he knew. I saw him beating the other until his face was no longer the same.
Those who will come after us need to know. This one killed. Might kill again.
One of us killed. I don't mind. It makes us stronger against others.
