It was the first time I ever saw anyone else. I didn’t know what to do.
It was the first time I ever saw anyone else, and I was afraid. I think we were all afraid.
It was the first time I ever saw anyone else. I decided to walk towards the silhouette.
It was the first time I ever saw anyone else. I was relieved; I thought I was the only one.
It was the first time I ever saw anyone else. I didn’t want it to be the last.
It was the first time I ever saw anyone else. From that moment on, I discovered loneliness.
