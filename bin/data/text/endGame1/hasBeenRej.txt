It might look easy, but it's not. Before finding this group, plenty of others pushed me back.
I tried again, and again. They always rejected me. I thought I was never going to find anyone open to me.
And yet, this group opened up to me. After so many unsuccessful tries, after so many hostile faces.
I don't know why the others looked at me that way. They wouldn't move, and I could do nothing but walk away.
