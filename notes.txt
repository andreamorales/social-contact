so when there is a conflict, the agent that is that the junction between two clusters is actually referenced in the arrayLists of both clusters,
even though he only seems to point to one cluster

still a bug with the length of the connection sometimes. it is too long and isn't removed past a certain length. when i click on an agent that is establishing the buggy lines,
it says i haven't established a cluster.

---------
when two agents fight, the losing agent isn't removed from the winner's cluster, so he technically lives on and is seen on the postGame screen.
i'm fixing it but that could be kind of cool to keep, as a ghost type of stuff.

so i haven't fixed it, and it looks like killing an agent does not give back the connection it should... so it's like a ghost taking away your interactions with society...
---------

arraylist of connections inside the agents
everytime an agent gets a connection, add it to that arraylist
calculate clusters based on that

go through all the connections an agent has, and make sure that all the agents at the other end of these connections have the same cluster


pass an arraylist to the function

once the agent is checked, add it to the arraylist. if the agent is not in the arraylist, check it.

when you add an agent to a cluster, make sure it's not already in there

every frame, make a new cluster

remove all stuff where you modifying the cluster agent relationship and it's overriding something.

error line 396 null pointer make sure every removal of agent is getting rid of
