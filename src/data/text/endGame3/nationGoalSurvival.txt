We wanted peace, and we had war. We wanted to raise families, and had burnt houses.
No matter how hard we tried, despair wouldn't leave us alone.
Our survival wasn't ours to decide.
We maintained peace, at all costs. Some called us naive.
We managed to avoid death, hunger and poverty, and lived a peaceful life.
We managed to remain above the turmoil of the land.
