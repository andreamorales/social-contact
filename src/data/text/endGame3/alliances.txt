Our nation took pride in the bonds it formed with its neighbors, close and distant. If not the land, we shared the same ideals.
Alliances were a key point of our foreign policy, throughout our different administrations.
I made friends from very different places, and yet we all shared some sort of common set of values. Friendship never appears out of nowhere.
Isolation was the necessary consequence for keeping our nation and our traditions together.
Despite our best efforts, every initiative we took to form alliances with others failed, again and again.
I began to have strong doubts about this country's ability to form and maintain relations with anyone else.
