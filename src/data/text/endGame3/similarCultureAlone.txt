It came to our attention that others, somewhere, led lives similar to ours, despite our lack of contact with the rest of the world.
We heard about others that shared our values; however, the distance was too much and we never made contact.
Our ideas and actions couldn't be so unique that no one else shared them. Whoever they were, we hoped to meet them.
Our history wasn't built on our alliances. It was built on our history.
Our traditions we upheld, and some took offense. We lived alone, and live as our own.
Not only did we not have friends, but no one seemed interested in our ways and customs. I don't think it would have fit them anyway.
