Since we shared most of our borders, the presence of others was constant.
Our history, our society, turned out to be significantly affected by our neighbors’.
The closer we seemed to be from each other, the more fascinated we were by them.
We grew mostly alone. Empty lands were our only witnesses -will they ever tell our story?
Our lack of neighbors might have been a factor, in that sense.
I don’t remember having strangers around, nor being able to go places.
