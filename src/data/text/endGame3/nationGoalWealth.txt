We always wanted to be amongst those whose wealth was the most impressive, and we were.
They envied us, and begged us for some of our money.
Wealth was the only power, and it was ours.
The hardest part was to realize that we failed at what we aimed to become.
We hoped to be rich, but weren't; and so we tried to turn to something else.
We adored wealth, and yet we remained poor.
