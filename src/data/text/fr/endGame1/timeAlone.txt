I wandered for so long. I saw others lie down in the distance, never to rise again; I almost lost hope.
I met some that looked like me in the beginning, but they quickly left. Until I met my own people, I thought I'd die alone.
I was happy, on my own. I wandered where I wanted, at the pace I wanted. But then the solitude turned into loneliness and I longed for company.
