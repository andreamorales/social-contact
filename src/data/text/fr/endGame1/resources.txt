Around me, the world was scattered with berries and nuts. I could take as much as I wanted, and I did.
So far, I had been alone, and there was plenty enough around for me to survive. I never thought it could disappear.
Alone, I had all the food I needed. Was there going to be enough for two?
Where I lived was barren. The first time I saw a patch of food, I decided it would be mine. If others wanted some, then we would see.
Where I walked no one else walked. And therefore, the first thing I ever owned was land.
There was land everywhere. I was the first one to say that it was mine. Others were naive enough to believe it.
