I knew some people that just changed radically, one day to the next. I'm glad that did not happen to me.
My friends and I were alike. Maybe too much, but that never bothered us.
For me, I never felt the need to differentiate myself from others, especially if they were my friends. Being like others made me happy.
One day, I did not want to be like them anymore. I wanted to be different. That caused some trouble, severed some bonds.
I realized one day that I was no different from the one next to me. I decided to put an end to that.
I know I changed radically from one day to the next. I do not regret it.
