Our friends and us shared and fostered these values, and sometimes it became hard to tell a country apart from another.
Some said we were all the same. They did not know that we chose to be that way.
Our culture was the world's culture -shared and admired by everyone.
Notwithstanding, we kept our cultural specificity, and remained a unique global actor.
We were always the same, and were always unique, despite all the friends we made.
Some did not understand why we were, why we acted that way. Our customs were our own.
