In part because of our repetitive war efforts, we fared better than our neighbours.
One of the main causes was obviously war. War never changes.
With it, came the fear. The fear of possible threats, of the ghost of war and the realities of its aftermath.
And yet, careful behaviour protected us from the toll of war.
Some declare it to be one of the reasons for an unexpected peaceful past.
From what I can remember, I never had to deal with violence -let alone on the scale of nations.
