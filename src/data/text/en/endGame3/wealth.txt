Overall, our growth was synonymous with the accumulation of wealth. It never seemed to stop.
We always had as much money as we could spend. And we spent.
I always had as much money as I could spend; so did everyone else. Money could just be printed.
Our reserves remained low for too long, and often loomed the specter of debt.
Consistent development was a struggle, with our restricted means.
We lived in poverty, even though some would deny that claim. I could not deny hunger.
