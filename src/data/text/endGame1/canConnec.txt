As we all strived to escape that loneliness, we wanted to gather in large groups. We didn't care about what would happen. About the history we'd bring to our group.
We didn't come that far, each from our own individual solitude, to limit ourselves to families. We wanted to be something bigger, and last longer.
The more we'd be, the tougher the competition. But those that would remain would be the best, and would carry on.
