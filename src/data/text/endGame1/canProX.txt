There's no reason why anyone should defend against a stranger. That's what we thought at the beginning, at least.
I wanted to fight back against any stranger. But no one else seemed to think that way, so I kept quiet.
I wish we could have done something to keep these intruders at bay. They were going to be trouble, in the end.
