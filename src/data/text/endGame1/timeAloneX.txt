I couldn't stand the loneliness. I always wanted to have someone by my side -no matter how different each one was from the previous one.
Still, I didn't mind the loneliness. Others kept on hanging on to me, but I didn't do that much.
All we have is not our selves, it's our relationships to others. I never wanted to be alone.
