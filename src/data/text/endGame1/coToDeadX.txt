I've heard stories of people dying horrible deaths. I don't think anyone here witnessed such a tragic event, though.
All of us are alive. That's all I have on my mind and all I will ever be thankful for.
I didn't have to see anyone's last moments. I don't think anyone could witness that and remain the same.
