Everywhere was the same, the same endless plains. We all adapted to that same grass sea.
Everywhere was the same, the same dried foothills. We all knew it, and it knew us.
Everywhere was the same, the same crooked beach. We all adapted to that same stripe of grey pebbles.
I've heard of people growing somewhere else, somewhere different. It wasn't as nice as where I grew up.
I've met some people who grew up in a different place. They mostly acted like us, except for some odd customs.
I wish I grew up somewhere else. I've seen places much prettier than were I was born. It's still home though.
