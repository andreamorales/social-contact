I did not have that many friends. Not that I wanted to. I lived on and survived.
I had few friends. We were close, but I wish I had more.
Everybody seemed to find me different. Maybe I was. Few like me, few friends.
I had many friends, still. And they stood by me.
Of all the friends I had, I liked all of them. Our relationships were tense, but we managed.
Our friends stayed within each other. We were very close.
