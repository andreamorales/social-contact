I've never oppressed someone. Not forcefully.
I never decided that someone should be subject to my will. No one should.
I never had to oppress someone. If someone told me to, I don't know what I would do.
I had to impose my will upon others. I had to make them go away and change who they are. They were threatening.
When they became to close, too similar, I made them go away. We are different for a reason.
I wouldn't call it oppression. Some of us are made to make decisions.
